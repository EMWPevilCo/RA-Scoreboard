# RA-Scoreboard
### This project was coded by [Porama6400](https://github.com/Porama6400) and [wit03](https://github.com/wit03) and used for [Roong-Aroon School](https://www.roong-aroon.ac.th) Sportweek 2019 We worked very hard on this project and try to make it overkill! Anyway this project was for education purposes feel free to use it.

## How it works
### We use basic HTML5 and Javascript for scoreboard interface and we use Node.js, Socket.io to be a Web Socket and host it on server.

## Usage
### 1. Install necessary packages
```
npm install
```
### 2. Run Node.js server (Node.js needs to be installed)
```
cd server 
node main.js
```
### 3. Open Admin Panel and Board Panel
 use the same access key to control Board Panel from Admin Panel
